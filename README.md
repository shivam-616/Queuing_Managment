## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run this project locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Java 17+
* Apache Maven 3.6+
* Docker and Docker Compose (Recommended)

### Local Development with Docker (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started, as it handles the database setup for you.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shivam-616/Queuing_Managment.git](https://github.com/shivam-616/Queuing_Managment.git)
    cd Queuing_Managment
    ```
2.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    This single command will build the application image and start both the application and the MySQL database containers.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
3.  **Access the application:**
    * **Application:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
